## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small React application containing the following files:

1. **index.html:** all websites and exercises start from the index.html.
2. **styles.css:** your CSS code goes here, some exercises will make you update this file.
3. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
4. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.
