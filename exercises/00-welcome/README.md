# Welcome to CSS Exercises!!

My name is Alejandro Sanchez [@alesanchezr](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr). I'm really excited to have you here !! 🎉 😂

Learning to code is hard; you will probably need coaching! DM me on Twitter if you have any questions.

During this course, you will be learning the following concepts:

1. How to apply CSS to your website in 3 different ways: Inline, by grouping them together inside a `<style>` tag, or using an external stylesheet `<link>`,

2. Selecting HTML Elements from your website to apply the styles to.

3. Apply CSS Rules (styles) to those elements.

4. Use the most popular CSS Rules.

5. Learn the most popular CSS Tricks.

As you may have noticed, HTML allows you to create only basic websites. Nobody wants to see a white website with some horrible text on it. So, it's time to learn what CSS is all about! Learn CSS to make your website beautiful. Let's make it shine!
